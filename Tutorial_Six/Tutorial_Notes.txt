- CSS:
* Basic Introduction:
CSS is a styling language that has been introduced to allow developers to style html pages to make 
it look more attractive. 

- Inline CSS:
* Idea:
The idea behind inline css is to add the code responsible for styling inside an html tag. 

* Structure:
To add the styling code within an html tag we need to do the following:
<tag_name style="[property:value;]*"> ... </tag_name>

* Advantages:
The advantage of using this approach is that you can customize each tag the way you want. 
For instance, if your code contains more than one <h1> tag, then for each tag you will be 
adding the styling code which will you to customize each tag the way you want. 

* Disadvantages:
The first disadvantage is that this approach will increase the amount of code and information 
inside the html page which might make it messy and hard to read. 

The second disadvantage is that in certain scenarios, the code might become harder to maintain 
because if we added a specific style to add tags of the same kind and now we want to change the 
content of the style or remove it from all tags, then we would have to go through each tag and 
change it manually which becomes a robust process. 

- Internal CSS:
* Idea:
The internal CSS is similar to the inline css such that both approaches require adding the css 
code to the html document. 

* Structure:
The main difference between internal and inline css is that internal adds the styling code outside 
the html tags. The styling code in this type of css is added in the head of the html page, and it 
looks something like the following:
<head>
    <style>
        tag_name {
            property:value;
            ...
        }
        .
        .
        .
    </style>
</head>

* Advantage:
Using internal css reduces the amount of code we have to write as we can define the style for all 
tags with the same title using one piece of code. 

* Disadvantages:
The disadvantage is that the html page will contain a lot of code and might end up looking confusing 
and messy. 

- External CSS:
* Idea:
The idea behind this approach is that all the styling code is put in a separate document external to 
the html code.

The external css code is then linked to the designated html page.

* Advnatages:
The advantage of this approach is that now we have more encapsulation than we used to and this allows 
us to build clean code that is maintainable and easy to debug. 

- Note:
While doing the tutorials, I have noticed that in html, we have the ability to define or set the default 
language of the webpage by using the following line of code:

<html lang="en | any other language"> ... </html>
