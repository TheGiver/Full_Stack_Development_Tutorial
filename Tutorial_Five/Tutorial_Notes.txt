- Ordered Lists:
* The idea:
If you had a list and you wanted to emphasise on the importance of 
ordering, then you can use ordered lists. 

* Tag:
<ol> <il></il> ... <ol>

- iFrames:
* What is it?
an iFrame is an HTML tag that allows developers to embed an html docu-
ment into the current HTML document. 

For instance, if we wanted to add an advertisement to the current document, 
then it is better to use an iFrame and import the desired html document into 
the current one. 

- form:
* The idea:
a form is another HTML tag/element that is used to collect user input.
