Sub-topic: HTML Forms, Img and Iframe Tags

- Ordered Lists:
* The idea:
If you had a list and you wanted to emphasise on the importance of 
ordering, then you can use ordered lists. 

* Tag:
<ol> <il></il> ... <ol>

- iFrames:
* What is it?
an iFrame is an HTML tag that allows developers to embed an html docu-
ment into the current HTML document. 

For instance, if we wanted to add an advertisement to the current document, 
then it is better to use an iFrame and import the desired html document into 
the current one. 

- form:
* The idea:
a form is another HTML tag/element that is used to collect user input. 

* The content of form elements:
The form element or tag can contain different embedded tags and those tags 
are known as form elements. 

Form elements are essentially different types of input elements and can include
the following:
a) Text fields
b) checkboxes
c) radio buttons
d) submit buttons 
etc. 

* The input element:
The input element is one of the tags that can be used inside the form element. 
This element is the most important element that could be used insie the form 
element. This element allows the web-page to accept input from the user. The type 
of input depends on the type attribute associated with the tag.

Ex.
<input type="[text | radio | submit]"> ... </input>

We will learn more about input types later on. 

* The label element:
This element allows the developer to attach a label or some sort of an identifier
to another element. By doing so, you can attach meaning to an element that might not 
be that clear to the user. For instance, when we have input elements, those elements do 
not actually make sense on their own. However, when attaching a label to an element, then 
the user can make sense of what each input field represents. 

* Discussing the input types:
As we have mentioned before, an input element could have one of the following types:
a) text
b) radio 
c) submit 

--> text:
The text type is essentially a text field that allows the user to input text. 

--> radio:
The radio type restricts the user to select one of the finite options provided 
to the user. 

--> submit:
This type allows the user to submit or send the information that he or she selected
on the webpage. The information uploaded by the user is then sent to a form-handler. 
The form-handler usually lies on the server side and its main purpose is to process 
the data submitted by the user by running specific javascripts on the data.
