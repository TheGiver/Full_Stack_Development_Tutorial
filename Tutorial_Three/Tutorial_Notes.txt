- Unordered Lists:
* What are they:
It is an html tag that allows you to inform the webpage 
that you would like to create a list of items where each 
item is placed on a new line. 

* Tag:
The tag for the unordered list looks something like the
following:
<ul> </ul>

Inside each list you need to use another tag which will 
allow you to give each item a bullet point. This tag has 
the following structure:
<li> -> Stands for 'list item'

* Making an item clickable:
To make an item clickable, you will need to add another 
tag and then provide the link to allow the webpage
to navigate between pages when those items are clicked. 

* Tag:
The tag has the following structure:
<a href="<link>"> item_name </a>

- Adding hyperreferences in html:
* What has been covered:
In the previous section, we have covered both the process 
of making an item clickable and the way we can add a hyper-
link to the item such that it allows the user to navigate from 
one page to another. 

* Observations:
I have noticed that all references need to be preceeded with 
an 'https://' otherwise the link will not work.
