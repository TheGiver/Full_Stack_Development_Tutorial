- Introduction:
In this tutorial, we will be talking about the different ways we can style different elements in 
a single html document. The approaches that we are going to discuss are:
a) Styling by element 
b) Styling by class 
c) Styling by ID 

- Styling by element:
* Explanation:
This form of styling involves creating a single style for all elements of the same tag_name. For 
instance, if we had a tag with the name <h1> and there were multiple instances of that tag, then 
they would all adpot the same style. Unless we want all the tags to adopt the same style, we can 
see why this approach is limiting and a bit useless when we want to provide each element with a 
different style. 

- Styling by class
* Explanation:
A class is an attribute that can be given to any html tag. The class is a way to identify an 
element and tends to be used for styling purposes. People tend to use class when they want to 
embedd CSS code. 

One thing to note about this attribute is that it is not a unique identifier. This means that we 
can have more than one element with the same class name and they will all adopt the same css style 
as defined by the developer. 

Finally, to style all elements that have the class attribute, we need to define in the CSS file that 
the block of styling code that we are about to provide belongs to all elements that have a particular 
class value. To do so, our css code will look something like the following:

.class_name {
    //styling code
}

- Styling by id:
* Explanation:
An id is a unique identifier that is given to a particular element. 

One thing to be aware off is that element ids are not usually used in styling as their main purpose 
is to embedd javascript scripts into the html code. But, in the scenario where we do use id's then 
the CSS file will look something like the following:

#id_name {
    //styling code
}
