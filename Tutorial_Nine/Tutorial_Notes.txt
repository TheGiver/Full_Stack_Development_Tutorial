- General Note:
One thing to note is that in CSS we can use general properties or branch into more specific properties. 
For instance, for a particular element in CSS, we can specify the property background [general property]
and then provide values for the different more specific properties in an organised matter. 
{You can check online documentations for a more descriptive representation of the paragraph above}

The advantages of using the more generic property is that you reduce the amount of code required to write.
Nonetheless, this might make the code less readable and harder to decode. 

- Background:
There is not much to say about this property. With the background property, you have the ability to set  
various background related styles such as a color or an image. 

In background, you have the option to use the generic 'background' property and provide more specific code 
as values to the property. Or, choose a more specific background related property and provide a specific 
value related to that property. 

- Borders:
As we all know, borders are essentially lines or markers that determine the borders of an element. The same 
definition applies to CSS and html; a border is nothing but a line that can be styled in different ways that 
marks the parameter of an element.
