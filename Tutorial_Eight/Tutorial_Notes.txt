- Colors:
* 3 Styles of choosing a color:
CSS allows you to set colors to elements in 3 different ways and those are:
a) Using the color name:
   You need to ensure that the color you select is a color that is supported by CSS, otherwise the color you 
   chose will not be selected. 

b) Using hexcode:
   Hexcode is essentially a number in hexadecimal format that represents a particular color. If you would like 
   to use a hexcode, then the number needs to attached to the # symbol. Usually a color is represented using a 
   6 digit hexacode. 

c) Using rgb():
   rgb() is a function that stands for [red | green | blue] and inside the function you specify 3 comma separated 
   values that range between 0-255 that determine the intensity of each of the 3 colors, and based on the combination 
   of primary colors used you can create secondary colors. 

- Gradient:
* Basic idea:
The idea behind a gradient is that you can play with the intensity of the color in one element. 
So, instead of having one shade of color x in the background of an element, you can have multiple 
shades which can make things prettier and more interesting. 

* Proper definition of a color gradient:
A color gradient allows a smooth transition between 2 or more colors in one area of the webpage. 

* Note:
One thing to note is that not all browsers/browser versions support the feature of gradients. Therefore, 
as a developer, you will have to cater for this situation either by:
1) Using a special command that is specific for each browser that informs the browser that a gradient is 
   being used at a specific place on the webpage
2) Add a default color that the webpage will choose if it does not support gradients

* Functions:
There are a lot of gradient related functions out there that could be used to add this feature. The most 
important thing is to look up their documentation when you want to use them as their parameters might d-
iffer. 

- Shadows:
* Main Idea:
The idea behind a shadow is simple, you literally create a shadow under an element to give it a 3d touch,
look or feeling. 

* What elements can be shadowed:
In CSS you and html you can shadow any element [text | image | div].

* What can you do with a shadow:
In CSS you can change the color of the shadow, its vertical | horizontal position and its intensity. 
All you need to do is understand how the different shadow properties can be used and what can they 
take as part of their parameters. 

* Observation: 
While watching the tutorial, I was a little bit confused regarding the values that the text-shadow 
accepts. Hence, I decided to experiment with them and was able to observe some stuff regarding the 
vertical and horizontal setting of the shadowing. 

text-shadow, box-shadow and other forms of shadow typically take a horizontal and vertical values 
that determine the direction [left | right & up | down] of the shadow. The values of these properties
look something like the following:

shadow_property: [horizontal shadowing {left | right}] [vertical shadowing [up | down]] [radius] [color]

As for the radius, it determines the intensity of the shadowing. In other words, the lower the radius, the 
more concentrated the shadowing is and vice versa.
