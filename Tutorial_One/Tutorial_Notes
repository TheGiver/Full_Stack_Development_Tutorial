- HTML:
* About HTML:
HTML is a markup language used to design websites.
The document is composed of embedded tags. 
All tags that are opened need to be closed 
in reverse order to which they were opened. 
What this means is that the tag last opened
is the first to be closed. 

* Basic Structure of an HTML file:
The first step towards building an html file is to define 
the declaration which could be done using the following line 
of code:
<!DOCTYPE html>

* Basic but interesting commands:
The first useful command to know is the <br> which is a line break. 
The second useful command is the <hr> which adds a horizontal line break. 
You can also go online where you can find a cheat sheet that allows you to 
understand and view the various commands available in html.
